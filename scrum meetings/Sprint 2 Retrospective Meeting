Agenda: 
- Discuss user study report and fixes for next sprint
- Discuss how we feel the process of the sprint went

Summary:
The team completed most core features and the sprint went smoothly overall, with only a brief login issue and some end-of-sprint time crunching. The user study revealed multiple UI/UX issues and bugs—such as styling inconsistencies and missing input limits—which will need to be addressed next sprint. While the sprint goals were largely met, the backlog will shift to prioritize polish, bug fixes, and small feature refinements based on user feedback.
