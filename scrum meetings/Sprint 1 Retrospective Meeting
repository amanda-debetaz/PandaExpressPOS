Agenda: 
  - Discuss what worked well
  - Discuss how to improve for the next sprint

Summary:
We all agreed that the sprint went pretty well and that using Jira to manage tasks worked very well for us ecspecially considering the confusion around tasks we had with the last project. There were a few learning curves for us to work through regarding the backend and full stack technology. Now that we are a bit more practiced with the technology, we think the next sprint will be even smoother and that we will be able to fine tune a few things.
