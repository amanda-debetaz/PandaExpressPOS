- Summary:
  We are making good progress on our tasks and have recently set up the login authorization, merged the back end and front end, and have built the base for the menu board. Our last tasks we need to complete are the basic layouts for the manager, cashier, and kitchen views. As we get close to the end of the sprint, we have reassigned the manager layout from Amanda to Alex to even out the remaining tasks between these members.
