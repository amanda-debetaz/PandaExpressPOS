- Summary:
We are a bit less confident in our timeline during this sprint compared to the first sprint. For this sprint we want to have a more completed project by the end instead of just having the base skeleton for each page. We are also realizing that the CSS styling will be more arduous than we previously thought. Besides those concerns we are still pretty confident in our ability to stick to the timeline.
